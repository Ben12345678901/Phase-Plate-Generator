# Phase-Plate-Generator
Random and distributed phase plate generator. Takes an input beam profile and ideal beam profile and utilises the greschberg saxton algorithim to produce a bespoke phase plate and outputs the material thickness required to produce the phase plate. In addition calculates the resultant focal spot which can be taliored at input.
